# 🎓 Academic Advisor Chatbot - CSUSB CSE  

🚀 **An AI-powered chatbot designed to assist students with academic advising at CSUSB's Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) department.**  

This chatbot leverages **Milvus (vector database), Large Language Models (LLMs), high-performance computing (HPC), and deep learning** to retrieve the most relevant responses to academic queries based on official university data.

---

## 🌟 Features  

✅ **Retrieves Academic Information**: The chatbot provides guidance on **courses, schedules, faculty, research opportunities, and resources** from official CSUSB CSE sources.  
✅ **Milvus Vector Search**: Uses **Milvus** as a high-speed vector database for storing and retrieving knowledge.  
✅ **Hybrid Search with RAG**: Implements **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to retrieve and summarize relevant information.  
✅ **LLM-Powered Responses**: Utilizes **Mistral-7B** to generate responses based strictly on academic content.  
✅ **Keyword Matching & Relevance Filtering**: Ensures high-quality, context-aware responses.  
✅ **Conversational Handling**: Recognizes basic greetings and common prompts.  
✅ **Interactive UI with Streamlit**: Runs on a **streamlit-based frontend**, making it user-friendly.  
✅ **HPC-Optimized**: Runs on **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** for fast processing and **99%+ accuracy** in bed posture recognition research.  
✅ **Jupyter Notebook (pynb) Representation**: A notebook version is available for better understanding of the chatbot's logic and architecture.

## 📌 Data Sources  

This chatbot is built using **verified academic sources** from CSUSB:  

📖 **CSUSB CSE Department Website**: [https://www.csusb.edu/cse](https://www.csusb.edu/cse)  
📑 **CSUSB Academic Catalog**: [https://catalog.csusb.edu/colleges-schools-departments/natural-sciences/computer-science-engineering/](https://catalog.csusb.edu/colleges-schools-departments/natural-sciences/computer-science-engineering/)  

The system **scrapes** these websites, stores structured content in **Milvus**, and retrieves information when queried.

## 🏗️ Architecture  

![arch-diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77fdb0ba-f891-4833-bd9d-4b3901c26db9)


The chatbot follows a **hybrid search + LLM** architecture:  

1️⃣ **Web Scraping & Data Storage**:  
   - Web pages are scraped and converted into a structured dataset.  
   - Data is **embedded using `SentenceTransformers (MiniLM-L6-v2)`** and stored in **Milvus**.  

2️⃣ **Query Processing & Context Matching**:  
   - User queries are transformed into **vector embeddings**.  
   - The chatbot **searches Milvus** for the most relevant documents.  
   - **TF-IDF keyword matching** helps refine results.  

3️⃣ **LLM Response Generation**:  
   - Uses **Mistral-7B** for generating responses based on retrieved context.  
   - Implements **prompt engineering techniques** to ensure factual correctness.  

4️⃣ **Interactive Streamlit UI**:  
   - Users interact with the chatbot in a web-based interface.  
   - Backend processes requests, generates responses, and returns them in real time.
